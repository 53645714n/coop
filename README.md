# coop

## The plan
The plan is to build a Raspberry Pi powered automatic chicken coop that:
- Turns on a light at dawn and opens the door
- Closes the door at sunset and some time later turns off the light
- Shows status via LED on outside
- Can be manipulated via remote control

## So far
So far I only got the sunrise and sunset times and a way to monitor if the coop door is open or closed. Motor is on its way and I'm wrestling the digital LED.
