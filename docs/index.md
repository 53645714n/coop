# The project explained
This project is the codebase for a complete, simple and flexible automated chicken coop. You don't need any programming experience, since all configuration is done in one simple file. You do need some soldering experience, but I am open to someone helping me design a proper pcb to make life easier.

## features
- Automatically open and close coop door
  - Hold the door closed at night
  - Slow enough for chickens to get out of the way
  - Early-open time, so the chickens won't wake the neighbours (or yourself)
  - Custom off-set, if you have early or lazy chickens on open- and closetime
- Automatically switch a relais
  - Switchable 5 or 12 volts
  - Can be scheduled with the door (either when it opens or closes) and on time
- Designed to run off-grid
- Human readable logging
- Screen support
