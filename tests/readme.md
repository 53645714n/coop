# About this folder

This folder contains some simple test scripts to test the different components while you connect them to your PI. I might even make a folder per component and a readme per component to make it as flexible as possible. Some people might not need a light, some people might not need a remote etc.

## led.py

led.py turns on and off two LEDs. I currently use them to test the channels for the motor.

## door.py

door.py monitors two sensors for opening the doors.
